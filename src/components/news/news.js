        content: `Metaverse is an online 3D universe that combines multiple virtual spaces with endless possibilities which allows users to meet, socialize, play and even work. <br/><br/>
        The closest metaverse experience that is out there is provided by video games with developers that expanded the gaming universe, creating in-game complex ecosystems with different types of utility tokens and valuable collectibles like NFTs. <br/><br/>
        The metaverse is powered by virtual reality and each user will have its own avatar or character. Let‚Äôs take a quick example: with the help of a VR headset you will connect to a blockchain-based game, use your avatar and check your crypto portfolio inside a metaverse platform. <br/><br/>
        Although it may seem like a movie scenario, we assure you that the future is closer than you think.<br/><br/>
        <b>Check out what the team has planned for you!</b><br/><br/>
        As we said in our previous articles, after CAWS minting is over, the next step is <b>a metaverse platform and a V.R. play-to-earn game</b> where you can use your NFT as a companion in your adventure or to check your crypto portfolio.<br/><br/>
        The game that we are currently developing will give you the opportunity to search for treasures, upgrade your character and also your cat, meet and interact with other users using a chatbox and much more.<br/><br/>
        <b>The Metaverse Mining play-to-earn game is a feature-rich RPG</b> where players can explore through endless mines, hunting for rewards, special items and digital currency.<br/><br/>
        The game features the main character and a cat (NFT) which will start the journey together to mine on different lands with different difficulty levels. Is it to be emphasized that the cat will not be a blocking point for the players to have at the first moment since they will have <b>the possibility to purchase a CAWS NFT in the Open World section.</b><br/><br/>
        What makes this <b>experience unique</b> is that almost all <i>items in the game are decentralized, using the power of innovative blockchain technology</i>. That means <b>players truly own their game assets</b> as they can freely trade them with other players, sell them for real-world value, and use them across different mines.<br/><br/>
        Our play-to-earn will have <b>different gameplay modes</b>, like:<br/><br/>
        <ul><li><b>‚Ä¢ Campaign</b> or <b>Multiplayer</b> and other sections like Inventory, where you will view the warehouse and item inventory collected</li><li><b>‚Ä¢ Credit Store,</b> where you will be able to buy DYP or iDYP for game use</li><li><b>‚Ä¢ News</b></li><li><b>‚Ä¢ Leaderboard</b> where you will be able to see the players rank and rewards.</li></ul><br/>
        ...and many more.<br/><br/>
        To give you that amazing VR experience we will prepare for you an <b>Open World that will include multiple features like:</b><br/><br/>
        <ul><li><b>‚Ä¢ Mall</b>‚Äî here you will have access to different shops and purchase gear, tools, consumable items etc.</li><li><b>‚Ä¢ Forge</b>‚Äî you will be able to forge different items.</li><li><b>‚Ä¢ Casino</b>‚Äî this will be a special place where you will be able to hang out, talk to other players and, of course, play with them different games.</li><li><b>‚Ä¢ NFT Marketplace</b>‚Äî Players can view different NFTs available and even purchase them.</li>
        <li><b>‚Ä¢ DYP Shop</b>‚Äî will allow you to access DYP‚Äôs products: Buyback, Vault, YieldFarming, Stake DYP, Referral, Bridge etc.</li><li><b>‚Ä¢ NPC</b>‚Äî  as in non player characters, will be all over the map and you will be able to interact with them and get all kinds of rewards.</li><li><b>‚Ä¢ Trade Section</b>‚Äî  here you will be able to sell or buy different items from other players.</li><li><b>‚Ä¢ Advertising Module</b>‚Äî  this section will be used for showing advertisement banners through the Open World.</li></ul>
        <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*CuSl1FG65e_xR7t-Cct5gg.jpeg'/><br/><br/>
        Now that we certainly got your attention, let‚Äôs see what other cool things we have prepared for our DYPians. For those of you that have <b>a CAWS NFT things will get super exciting.</b> Your cat avatar will help you in your quests to find different rewards or dig faster for your treasures.<br/><br/>
        Also, in a world full of dangerous creatures, your cat will protect you against rats, snakes, spiders, scorpions and many more. Another awesome thing that <b>you will benefit from will be your cat‚Äôs instincts:</b><br/><br/>
        <ul><li>‚Ä¢ The ability <b>to sense</b> incoming dangers ahead</li><li>‚Ä¢ <b>Hearing </b>‚Äî the cat can hear noises from far away, such as rocks collapsing nearby or storms approaching</li><li>‚Ä¢ <b>Visibility</b>‚Äî the cat has night vision and it will help you in the dark.</li><li>‚Ä¢ <b>Orientation</b>‚Äî the cat can find its way in the mine if you are lost.</li><li>‚Ä¢ <b>Smell</b>‚Äî your cat character will be able to smell toxic gasses and warn you.</li></ul><br/><br/>
        These are just <i><b>some of the advantages that your CAWS character will give you in our future play-to-earn game.</b></i> Makes you think about it, doesn‚Äôt it?
        Things will get more exciting once you will start to get experience and upgrade your character and your pet from beginner up to expert level.<br/><br/>
        Last but not least, we will have a Ballance section where you will be able <b>to deposit DYP and iDYP to your wallets, withdraw rewards or transfer credits inside the game.</b><br/><br/>
        Now that you know a little bit about the things that we are developing, we hope you are as excited as we are for the amazing things that are coming.`,

        The team at DeFi Yield Protocol is continuing to explore ways of making the ecosystem bigger and better through adding more promising blockchain networks. DeFi Yield Protocol currently supports the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche networks. <br/><br/>
        Today marks yet another level of expansion for our DeFi ecosystem, as we‚Äôre expanding to Polygon to implement its network and technology on the DeFi Yield Protocol.<br/><br/>
        DeFi Yield Protocol‚Äôs expansion to Polygon is set for completion in November 2021 and will initially launch with five products: DYP Farming, DYP Staking, DYP Buyback, DYP Tools, and DYP NFTs.<br/><br/>
        <a href='https://tools.dyp.finance/' target='_blank'><u>DYP Tools</u> </a>provides advanced features, such as Decentralized Score, Unique Community Trust Vote System, DYP Locker, Yield Farm Data, and LaunchPad. This integration allows users to make informed decisions.<br/><br/>
        <a href='https://nft.dyp.finance/' target='_blank'><u>DYP NFTs</u> </a>will be a marketplace that allows artists to mint, trade, feature and sell their creative work to the network of users on Polygon with low fees, and application performance.<br/><br/>
        <b>About DYP‚Äôs Anti-Manipulation feature</b><br/><br/>
        DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) works to curb the influence of large whale users. The protocol employs an anti-manipulation feature that aims to limit the market impact on users.<br/><br/>
        Anti-manipulation aims to maintain stability, fair access to liquidity, and provide a secure and simplified DeFi platform for users of all sizes.<br/><br/>
        <b>Polygon Overview</b><br/><br/>
        Polygon (formerly known as Matic Network) is a protocol and framework that enhances the building of and interconnectivity between Ethereum and other compatible networks. Its full-stack scaling solution provides more efficient payment and lending solutions, token swaps, and application performance.<br/><br/>
        It was mainly designed to attract users to its platform by solving the inefficiencies experienced by users and developers on Ethereum by offering superior user experience and security.<br/><br/>
        Polygon operates using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Commit Chain mechanism to help increase adoption for Ethereum and has already attracted over 500 dApps to its growing ecosystem. These special chains operate as transaction networks and work alongside blockchains to confirm clusters of transactions before transferring data back to the main chain.<br/><br/>
        MATIC is the protocol‚Äôs native token that helps power and secure the underlying network, while also serving as the main form of payment for transaction fees and access for developers to build dApps.<br/><br/>
        <b>About Polygon</b><br/><br/>
        <b><a href='https://polygon.technology/' target='_blank'><u>Polygon</u></a>is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development.</b>Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports <b>building and connecting</b> Secured Chains like Optimistic Rollups, zkRollups, Validium, etc, and Standalone Chains like Polygon POS, designed for flexibility and independence. Polygon‚Äôs scaling solutions have seen widespread adoption with 500+ Dapps, ~567M+ txns, and ~6M+ daily txns.<br/><br/>

        1. You need to visit <a href='https://avax-bridge.dyp.finance/' target='_blank'><u>https://avax-bridge.dyp.finance/</u></a><br/>
        2. Now, you should click ‚Äò‚ÄôCONNECT WALLET‚Äô‚Äô and log into your MetaMask wallet.<br/>
        <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*qRrSIYWtrtVXdBXniUsBFg.jpeg' alt=''/><br/>
        3.  You need to choose Ethereum Network from the MetaMask menu.<br/>
        <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*QVyexomoQYU4DqAGLgGeeA.jpeg' alt=''/> <br/>
        4.  Now, you need to input the amount of tokens that you want to swap from Ethereum to Avalanche Network. In my case, it will be 1 DYP tokens. Next, you need to click Approve and wait for the transaction to be confirmed. Once the transaction is confirmed, you need to click Deposit and again wait for the transaction to be confirmed.<br/>
        <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*NpYd9_j_JFD6lz9zg3lePg.jpeg' alt =''/> <br/>
        5.  After the deposit is confirmed, you will get your transaction hash for the deposit. After 12 confirmations on the Ethereum Network, you will be able to withdraw the DYP tokens to your Avalanche Wallet.<br/><br/>
        <i>Note:</i>For the Avalanche wallet you will have the same public address like the one from the Ethereum Network, that means you will use the same MetaMask wallet and withdraw the tokens to the same public address.<br/>
        <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GuF4wHdMCNyvZxu4c2BeDw.jpeg' alt =''/> <br/>
        6.  Now, you need to change the Network from Ethereum to AVAX in order to complete the swap.<br/>
        <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*gNcEuggt0gCKQtiKhFGG5g.jpeg' alt =''/> <br/>
        7.  After you have changed the network you need to wait for the transaction to be confirmed and click withdraw.<br/>
        <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*B6oBxskkZ6RqZZGJagMdUw.jpeg' alt =''/> <br/>
        8.  Once the transaction has been confirmed on Ethereum Network, the WITHDRAW button will be enabled.<br/>

        9.  You need to click WITHDRAW and confirm the transaction in order to receive the DYP tokens on your Avalanche wallet. Once the transaction has been confirmed on Avalanche Network, you will be able to see the tokens on your balance.<br/>
        <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*sN12atazT_2llpLb6TBTZA.jpeg' alt =''/> <br/><br/>
        <i>Note</i><br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢We recommend on saving the transaction hash in case you have network issues, to be able to make the withdraw later.<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢Please note that the maximum amount that you can swap per wallet every 24 hours is maximum 10,000 DYP tokens.<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢In order to swap DYP tokens from the Avalanche to the Ethereum Network, you need to follow the same steps.<br/><br/>

        content: `NFTs are the collectible cards of today‚Äôs world. Instead, they are unique and exist on the blockchain. With the rise in the popularity of NFTs, every blockchain project wants to add an NFT marketplace to its platform. However, creating a thriving NFT marketplace requires robust integration with an underlying protocol.<br/><br/>
        DeFi Yield Protocol, a decentralized platform with an aim to create a transparent, unbiased, and reliable network, is launching its <a href='https://nft.dyp.finance/' target='_blank'><u>NFT dApp V1</u></a>.<br/><br/>
        <b>About the NFT dApp</b><br/><br/>
        <a href='https://dyp.finance/' target='_blank'><u>DeFi Yield Protocol</u></a> is a Yield Farming protocol that aims to mitigate the whale manipulation found on other platforms. The latest addition of the NFT dApp will add value to the already invaluable ecosystem and provide new use cases for the community.<br/><br/>
        This NFT dApp will be launched on the Ethereum network, which will act as the de-facto platform for artists to trade, mint, sell, buy and auction their unique digital assets. The lower transaction costs and the environmentally friendly approach of the DYP‚Äôs <a href='https://nft.dyp.finance/' target='_blank'><u>NFT dApp</u></a> distinguish it from other dApps.<br/><br/>
        This release will be a monumental achievement for the DYP ecosystem as it will open up various opportunities for the artists and the art world.
        <b>The UI of DYP‚Äôs NFT dApp</b><br/>
        The NFT dApp by Defi Yield Protocol acts as a marketplace and a gallery where users can mint, buy, sell and trade NFTs for a fixed price. Every NFT will be associated with an image, title, description, ID, and some tags. Users can either search for a particular NFT using the ID or browse in the gallery using the artist‚Äôs name and profile picture.<br/><br/>
        The app will contain the following elements:<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢<b>Marketplace List Page:</b>On this page, all the listings will be displayed along with their price and the option to purchase them.<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢<b>Create Page:</b>Artists and users can upload their artwork here as a JPG file with the item‚Äôs description to create an NFT. By paying the creation fee to the admin wallet, users will be able to see their minted NFTs in their wallets.<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢<b>My Account Page:</b>My account page will allow the users to see their Ether and NFT balance, the tokens they own or are listed for sale. They can also unlist their tokens here to take them out of the Marketplace List Page.<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢<b>Non-Fungible Token Details Page:</b>On the marketplace list page, when users click on an NFT, they will be redirected to this page to see all the info about the NFT, such as artists‚Äô name, title, description, etc.<br/><br/><br/>
        <b>The Launch NFT Collection by Nidia Toska</b><br/>
        Prior to the launch of the dApp, DYP has collaborated with <a href='https://www.instagram.com/nidia_art/' target='_blank'><u>Nidia Toska</u></a>, a renowned fashion illustrator and designer, to create the first collection to be listed on the marketplace. <a href='https://www.instagram.com/nidia_art/' target='_blank'><u>Nidia Toska</u></a> is a prominent fashion designer who has worked with celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton, GQ magazine, and more. Over the years, she has developed an impressive portfolio and is confident with her work.<br/><br/>
        Nidia takes inspiration from what‚Äôs happening in the industry and creates a masterpiece loved by everyone. When she is not working on designing a new piece for someone, she spends hours creating illustrations that she shares on her Instagram channel. It was only a hobby for Nidia, but she gained followers when Kim Kardashian reshared a portrait of hers drawn by Nidia.<br/><br/>
        Nidia is so confident that she draws all her artwork freehand on an iPad. Every artwork is unique and cannot be imitated, which makes the NFT collection even more special.<br/><br/><br/>

        content: `We‚Äôre excited to announce that DeFi Yield Protocol, a unique platform that allows any user to provide liquidity has integrated <a href='https://data.chain.link/' target='_blank'><u>Chainlink Price Feeds</u></a> on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain mainnet. By integrating Chainlink‚Äôs industry-leading decentralized oracle network, DeFi Yield Protocol has access to high-quality, tamper-proof price feeds needed to provide the exact value in USD. This will provide our users with strong assurances that all the values are provided in a fully decentralized manner and cannot be manipulated.<br/><br>
        Our initial integration involves the use of the following Chainlink Price Feeds: ETH-USD and BNB-USD. We chose Chainlink as our go-to oracle solution because its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. Chainlink already secures leading DeFi protocols responsible for billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and <a href='https://blog.chain.link/flash-loans/' target='_blank'><u>data manipulation attacks via flash loans.</u></a><br/><br/>
        DeFi Yield Protocol is a unique platform that allows any user to provide liquidity and uses an anti-manipulation feature.<br/><br/>
        The core feature of DeFi Yield Protocol is the decentralized tools dashboard (DYP Tools). DYP Tools provide a liquidity locker for any DeFi project, a unique voting system, and at the same time protect the DeFi community by providing a decentralized trust score for all the DeFi projects.<br/><br/>
        In order to secure our ETH and BNB data values in a decentralized manner, we needed access to fresh asset prices that are supplied directly on-chain in a highly reliable manner. Fair market asset prices should reflect a volume-weighted average from all trading environments, so we need to make use of an oracle to fetch aggregated price data off-chain and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by our application.<br/><br/>
        After reviewing various oracle solutions, we integrated Chainlink Price Feeds because they provide a multitude of critical features such as:<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢ <b>High-Quality Data</b> ‚Äî Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, ensuring broad market coverage through price data that‚Äôs aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned of outliers and wash trading. Chainlink‚Äôs data aggregation model generates accurate global market prices that are inherently resistant to inaccuracies or manipulation of any single or small set of exchanges.<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Secure Node Operators</b> ‚Äî Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, security-reviewed, and Sybil-resistant oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises. Chainlink nodes have a strong track record of reliability, even during high gas prices and infrastructure outages.<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Decentralized Network</b> ‚Äî Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by either the data provider or oracle network.<br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Reputation System</b> ‚Äî Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of node operators and oracle networks.<br/><br/><br>
        In the near future we plan on using Chainlink for providing additional price feeds for all of our farming, staking, and vault pools. Also, we want to integrate Chainlink services on DYP Tools to provide a better experience for all the users.<br/><br/>
        "Without doubt Chainlink is the most powerful and reliable Oracle when it comes to High-Quality Data, Secure Node Operators, Decentralized Network, and Reputation System. From the beginning we have put the security and transparency for our project in the first place. By integrating Chainlink services we manage to add more security and transparency to our whole ecosystem. This is one of the most important tasks for any DeFi platform! We look forward on adding more with Chainlink!"<br/><br/>
        Mihai Nicusor Busica ‚Äî CEO DeFi Yield Protocol<br/><br/>
        <b>About Chainlink</b><br/><br/>

        content: `<h3>We've submitted a proposal to launch one of the first joint liquidity mining programs for the @KyberNetwork #KyberDMM on @avalancheavax featuring $DYP and $KNC rewards!</h3><br/><br/>
        <b>1. Project Introduction</b><br/>
        The DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) is a unique platform that offers solutions for yield farming, staking, NFTs, and enabling users to leverage the advanced trading tools of the DYP. What makes the DYP a unique yield farming aggregator? The DYP made history in the DeFi space by becoming the first and only protocol to reward users in Ethereum.<br/>
        The protocol employs an anti-manipulation feature that aims to limit the market impact on users‚Äô converting rewards into ETH and other native platform tokens. Anti-manipulation aims to maintain stability, fair access to liquidity, and provide a secure and simplified DeFi platform for users of all sizes.
        The core feature of the DYP is the decentralized tool dashboard. It provides advanced features, such as Decentralized Score, Unique Community Trust Vote System, DYP Locker, Yield Farm Data, and LaunchPad, allowing investors to make informed decisions that maximize yields and reduce risks.<br/>
        <b>DeFi Yield Protocol is a multi-chain platform available on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche. Since launch our users have earned 8791 ETH, 7195 BNB, and 11438 AVAX worth $34,648,092.</b><br/>
        What is the use case of DYP token? DYP serves as the fuel for all products in the DeFi Yield Protocol ecosystem and it could be used in the following use cases:<br/><br/>
        Transaction fees for NFTs smart contract operations<br/>
        Staking on Ethereum Network<br/>
        Yield Farming on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche<br/>
        Part of the DYP Earn Vault Strategies<br/>
        Community voting for decentralized Governance<br/>
        DYP Referral System<br/>
        Subscription tokens for DYP Tools Premium<br/>
        DYP Locker fulfil security for smart contracts by locking their liquidity; DYP is the token used for the liquidity lock<br/>
        DYP Launchpad v1.0 will offer multiple tiers based on amount of locked DYP<br/><br/>
        This is just scratching the surface, though. Ultimately, DYP is a requirement for entering the DeFi Yield Protocol ecosystem and unlocking an unprecedented level of security for projects and individual asset holders.<br><br/><br/>
        <b>2. Proposal Summary, Motivation, and Key Details</b><br/>
        DeFi Yield Protocol is proposing a joint liquidity program with Kyber on the Avalanche network.<br/><br/>
        As part of this program, users will be able to provide liquidity to the upcoming DYP-WAVAX pair on KyberDMM to receive dedicated LP tokens. These tokens can be staked to earn dual rewards in both DYP and KNC at a 2:1 ratio.<br/><br/>
        With the incentivized pool, KyberDMM will become a primary location for DYP trading on Avalanche. Another important aspect of the collaboration will be the integration of DYP Tools with KyberDMM for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche networks.<br/><br/>
        <b>Motivation:</b><br/><br/>
        DeFi Yield Protocol has been already integrated with Avalanche and launched a couple of products including yield farming with AVAX rewards, buyback program, bridge, and DYP Tools. The integration with Avalanche also includes DYP NFTs and LaunchPad, these products are expected to be launched in the next 30 days. <b>Since the launch of the DYP Farming on Avalanche that happened two months ago, we have paid to the farmers 11438 AVAX worth $830,170. Also, in just one-month DYP worth $370,425.35 has been bought using the Buyback program on Avalanche.</b><br/>
        DYP Tools launch on Avalanche took place just two weeks ago and we have at least 1000 unique users each week from Avalanche network.<br/><br/>
        With this program we will attract more DeFi users found within the Kyber community, with DYP-KNC reward distribution. Our goal is to expand both Kyber and DeFi Yield Protocol ecosystems.<br/><br/><br/>
        <b>3. KNC Amount Requested</b><br/>
        USD $100k in KNC incentives<br/><br/>
        <b>4. Project Contribution Amount</b><br/>
        DeFi Yield Protocol will provide $200k worth of DYP rewards for 8 weeks, in addition to seeding the initial liquidity at a level between $400k and $600k, depending on market conditions at the time of pool creation. The pair will be DYP-WAVAX.<br/><br/>
        <b>5. Network</b><br/>Avalanche<br/><br/>
        <b>6. Token pair option</b><br/>Others<br/><br/>
        <b>7. Vesting Schedule</b><br/>No vesting<br/><br/>
        <b>8. Campaign Duration</b><br/>2 months<br/><br/>

        <h3>Campaign Terms</h3><br/><br/>
        ‚Ä¢ Start Date: September 21, 2021 00:00 UTC<br/>

        <h3>About DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP)</h3><br/><br/>
        DeFi Yield Protocol is a unique platform that allows any user to provide liquidity, receive rewards in ETH or BNB for the first time since DeFi started, and use an anti-manipulation feature to convert the rewards into ETH or BNB without overly affecting the price. In other words, any person can provide liquidity and earn ETH or BNB with minimum risks.<br/><br/>
        DeFi Yield Protocol is the FIRST and the ONLY yield farming aggregator that is rewarding the liquidity providers in Ethereum (for the Ethereum Network) or BNB/ETH/DYP (for the Binance Smart Chain Network). In order to lower the risk of DYP price volatility, all pool rewards are automatically converted from DYP to ETH/BNB by the smart contract, and ETH/BNB/DYP is distributed as a reward to the liquidity providers. The users can choose between three different types of rewards: ETH, BNB, or DYP.<br/><br/>
        The yield farming is available on both Ethereum (ETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT pools on Uniswap) and Binance Smart Chain (BNB, ETH, BUSD pools on PancakeSwap) Networks. The liquidity providers can earn up to 231.64% APY according to DeFi Yield Protocol. It also has a Bridge that will help the users swap DYP tokens between Ethereum Network and Binance Smart Chain Network.<br/><br/>
